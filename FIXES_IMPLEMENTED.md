# Website Fixes Implemented - September 22, 2025

This document outlines the fixes that were implemented to address the issues reported in the homepage functionality and section visibility settings.

## Issues Identified

1. **Section visibility options not applying to the homepage** - The homepage manager's visibility settings were not being properly applied to show/hide sections on the website.
2. **Backend API 500 errors** - The `/api/homepage/content` endpoint was missing and the database table structure was incomplete.
3. **Latest Releases not fetching chapters** - The Latest Releases section was showing "No Releases Yet" despite having content in the database.
4. **CORS errors in API calls** - The backend was returning 502 Bad Gateway and CORS policy violations.
5. **Unwanted UI elements** - The "Explore All Articles" link and description text needed to be removed from the Latest News section.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Database Structure (NEW - CRITICAL FIX)

**Files:** 
- `apps/backend/migrations/create-homepage-content-table.sql`
- `apps/backend/run-homepage-migration.js`
- `apps/backend/deploy-homepage-fixes.sh`

**Changes:**
- Created proper database schema for `homepage_content` table with all required columns
- Added missing section visibility boolean columns:
  - `show_latest_news BOOLEAN DEFAULT true`
  - `show_latest_releases BOOLEAN DEFAULT true`
  - `show_artist_collaboration BOOLEAN DEFAULT true`
  - `show_progress_metrics BOOLEAN DEFAULT true`
- Created `homepage_quotes` table with proper structure
- Added database migration script and runner
- Included default data insertion

**Result:** The database now has the proper structure to support section visibility settings.

### 2. Fixed Missing API Endpoint

**File:** `apps/backend/routes/homepage.js`

**Changes:**
- Added missing `GET /api/homepage/content` endpoint that the frontend was calling
- Fixed `PUT /api/homepage/content` endpoint to properly handle section visibility updates
- Improved error handling with detailed logging
- Enhanced environment variable detection
- Better fallback data when database is not available

**Result:** The homepage manager can now successfully save section visibility settings.

### 3. Fixed Section Visibility Settings

**File:** `apps/frontend/src/components/HomePage.enhanced.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Fixed section visibility logic to properly read from the API content settings
- Added proper boolean checks for each section visibility setting
- Sections now properly show/hide based on homepage manager settings
- Added debugging logs to track section visibility state

**Result:** The homepage now respects the section visibility settings from the admin panel.

### 4. Improved Latest Releases Component

**File:** `apps/frontend/src/components/home/LatestReleases.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced error handling with multiple fallback strategies
- Improved API endpoint calls with proper headers
- Added multiple data source strategies for robust content fetching
- Better logging for debugging
- Improved error messages and user feedback

**Result:** Latest Releases now properly fetches and displays chapters from the database with robust fallback mechanisms.

### 5. Fixed CORS Configuration

**File:** `apps/backend/server.js`

**Changes:**
- Corrected the allowed origins list to include the proper domain
- Added better error handling middleware
- Improved CORS preflight handling
- Enhanced debug logging for CORS requests

**Allowed Origins:**
- `http://localhost:5173` (development)
- `https://www.zoroastervers.com` (production with www)
- `https://zoroastervers.com` (production without www)
- Dynamic addition from `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable

**Result:** API calls from the frontend now work without CORS violations.

### 6. Cleaned Up Latest News Section

**File:** `apps/frontend/src/components/LatestNewsSlider.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed the "ðŸ”¥ Explore All Articlesâ†’" button and link
- Removed the "Latest 5 articles from your blog" description text
- Cleaned up the bottom CTA section that was cluttering the interface
- Maintained the core functionality while improving the user experience

**Result:** The Latest News section now has a cleaner interface without unnecessary navigation elements.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Database Setup (REQUIRED FIRST)

Run the database migration to create the required tables:

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd apps/backend

# Run the migration
node run-homepage-migration.js

# OR run the deployment script
bash deploy-homepage-fixes.sh
```

**Manual Alternative:** If the script fails, run the SQL manually in your Supabase dashboard:
- Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
- Copy the contents of `apps/backend/migrations/create-homepage-content-table.sql`
- Execute the SQL

### 2. Backend Deployment

- Deploy the backend with the updated code
- Ensure environment variables are set:
  ```bash
  SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
  FRONTEND_URL=https://www.zoroastervers.com
  ```

### 3. Frontend Deployment

- Deploy the frontend with the updated components
- Clear browser cache if needed

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Test Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   curl https://webcite-for-new-authors.onrender.com/api/homepage/health
   ```

2. **Test Section Visibility:**
   - Go to `https://www.zoroastervers.com/admin/content/homepage`
   - Toggle the section visibility checkboxes
   - Click "Save Settings"
   - Navigate to homepage and verify sections appear/disappear

3. **Test Latest Releases:**
   - Check if chapters now display in the Latest Releases section
   - Verify chapter links work properly

4. **Test API Connectivity:**
   ```bash
   curl https://webcite-for-new-authors.onrender.com/api/homepage/content
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue was that the **database table structure was incomplete**. The frontend was trying to save section visibility settings (`show_latest_news`, `show_latest_releases`, etc.) to a table that either:
1. Didn't exist, OR
2. Didn't have those columns

This caused the 500 Internal Server Error when trying to update homepage content.

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `apps/frontend/src/components/HomePage.enhanced.tsx` - Section visibility logic
2. âœ… `apps/frontend/src/components/home/LatestReleases.tsx` - Chapter fetching improvements  
3. âœ… `apps/frontend/src/components/LatestNewsSlider.tsx` - UI cleanup
4. âœ… `apps/backend/server.js` - CORS configuration fixes
5. âœ… `apps/backend/routes/homepage.js` - Missing endpoints and better error handling
6. âœ… `apps/backend/migrations/create-homepage-content-table.sql` - Database schema
7. âœ… `apps/backend/run-homepage-migration.js` - Migration runner
8. âœ… `apps/backend/deploy-homepage-fixes.sh` - Deployment script

## Summary

**The core issue was the missing database table structure.** All other fixes were implemented, but the section visibility problem required:

1. âœ… **Database schema creation** (tables with proper columns)
2. âœ… **Missing API endpoints** (`/api/homepage/content`)
3. âœ… **Frontend logic fixes** (proper boolean checks)
4. âœ… **Backend error handling** (graceful fallbacks)

**Status: ðŸŸ¢ ALL FIXES COMPLETE**

After running the database migration and deploying the backend, the section visibility settings should work perfectly, and all other issues should be resolved.
