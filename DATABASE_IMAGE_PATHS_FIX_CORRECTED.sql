-- VERIFICATION QUERIES (run these after to confirm success)
-- ============================================================================

/*
VERIFICATION QUERIES - Run these separately to confirm the fix worked:

-- 1. Check if any characters still have null portrait_url
SELECT COUNT(*) as characters_missing_portrait_url 
FROM characters 
WHERE portrait_url IS NULL OR portrait_url = '';

-- 2. Check if any blog posts still have null featured_image
SELECT COUNT(*) as blog_posts_missing_featured_image 
FROM blog_posts 
WHERE featured_image IS NULL OR featured_image = '';

-- 3. Sample characters with the default image
SELECT name, portrait_url 
FROM characters 
WHERE portrait_url = 'characters/default-character.jpg'
LIMIT 5;
