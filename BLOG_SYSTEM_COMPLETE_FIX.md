## 🚑 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### Step 1: Fix Database (CRITICAL - Do This First) 😨

**Go to Supabase → SQL Editor → Copy and run this:**

```sql
-- CRITICAL: Fix your blog_posts table structure
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS author_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS cover_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS featured_image TEXT;
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS author TEXT;
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS views INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS likes_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS comments_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft';

-- Fix existing posts
UPDATE blog_posts SET status = 'published', published_at = NOW() WHERE status IS NULL OR status = '';
UPDATE blog_posts SET views = 0 WHERE views IS NULL;
UPDATE blog_posts SET likes_count = 0 WHERE likes_count IS NULL;
UPDATE blog_posts SET author = 'Zoroastervers Team' WHERE author IS NULL;

SELECT 'Database fixed! 🎆' as result;
```

### Step 2: Check Your Posts Status 🔍

**Run this diagnostic script:**

```sql
-- Check what posts you have and their status
SELECT 
    title,
    status,
    published_at,
    CASE 
        WHEN status = 'published' THEN '✅ Will show on /blog'
        ELSE '⚠️ Hidden from /blog'
    END as visibility
FROM blog_posts 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Step 3: Publish Your Test Post 📢

**If your test post has `status = 'draft'`, publish it:**

```sql
-- Publish all your posts so they appear on /blog
UPDATE blog_posts 
SET status = 'published', published_at = NOW() 
WHERE status != 'published';

SELECT 'All posts published! 🎉' as result;
```

### Step 4: Get Your User ID (For Author Attribution) 👤

```sql
-- Find your user ID
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users;

-- Update posts to have you as author (replace with your actual user ID)
-- UPDATE blog_posts SET author_id = 'paste-your-user-id-here' WHERE author_id IS NULL;
```

## 🎉 **WHAT WILL WORK AFTER THE FIX**

## 💡 **Why Your Posts Weren't Appearing**
