## 3. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)

*   **Dashboard Overview:** A customizable homepage with key metrics and quick links to frequently used modules.
*   **Navigation:** Clear, consistent sidebar navigation for easy access to all modules.
*   **Search & Filtering:** Robust search and filtering capabilities within each module to quickly find specific data.
*   **Data Tables:** Sortable, filterable, and paginated tables for displaying lists of items (e.g., products, users, orders).
*   **Forms:** Intuitive forms for creating and editing content, with validation and clear feedback.
*   **Security:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure administrators only access modules relevant to their permissions.

## 4. Integration with Project Documentation

*   The admin dashboard should reflect the data structures and workflows defined in documents like:
    *   [[shop_commerce/product_hierarchy|Product Hierarchy]]
    *   [[shop_commerce/pricing_strategy|Pricing Strategy]]
    *   [[shop_commerce/subscription_models|Subscription Models]]
    *   [[content_management/content_model|Content Model]]
    *   [[content_management/spoiler_system/modes-and-defaults|Spoiler System Modes]]

    *   [[operations_admin/kpis_analytics_spec|KPIs & Analytics Spec]]

## 5. Admin Roles (Examples)

*   **Super Admin:** Full access to all modules.
*   **Content Editor:** Access to content management modules.
*   **Commerce Manager:** Access to commerce tools.
*   **Beta Coordinator:** Access to beta operations.

## 6. Technical Considerations

*   **Backend API:** A robust API to support all dashboard functionalities.
*   **Frontend Framework:** (To be determined in [[core_platform/architecture_blueprint#technical-stack|Technical Stack]] section).
*   **Security:** Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
