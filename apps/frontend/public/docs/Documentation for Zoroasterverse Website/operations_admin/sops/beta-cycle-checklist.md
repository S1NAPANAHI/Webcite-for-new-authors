# Admin SOP: Beta Cycle Checklist

**Objective:** To provide a step-by-step checklist for running a beta cycle, from application to review conversion, ensuring consistent execution and data collection.

---

This checklist should be used in conjunction with the [[beta-program/operational-timeline]] and [[beta-program/metrics-and-dashboards]].

### Planning (T-21 to T-7 days)

1.  **Define Cycle Parameters:**
    *   [ ] Set cohort target (40–60 readers), reading window (2 weeks), and review window (1 week).
    *   [ ] Prepare application form and excerpt for feedback task, as per [[beta-program/application-spec]].
    *   [ ] Confirm scoring weights and tie-breakers, as per [[beta-program/scoring-rubric-and-weights]].
    *   [ ] Prepare all email templates (acceptance, waitlist, reminders, revocation, launch-day conversion) as defined in [[beta-program/emails]].

### Applications (T-7 to T-1 days)

1.  **Open Applications:**
    *   [ ] Open the beta application form on the website.
    *   [ ] Monitor completion rate and address any technical issues.
2.  **Close Applications & Score:**
    *   [ ] Close applications on the specified date.
    *   [ ] Export applications to the scoring sheet.
    *   [ ] Apply automated scoring and rank applicants.
    *   [ ] Enforce cohort quotas (device/timezone/experience) as per [[beta-program/cohort-balancing-rules]].
    *   [ ] Build final cohort and waitlist, following the [[beta-program/selection-algorithm]].

### Onboarding (T0 to T+2 days)

1.  **Send Notifications:**
    *   [ ] Send Acceptance emails to selected cohort members.
    *   [ ] Send Waitlist emails to waitlisted applicants.
2.  **Collect NDAs & Provision Access:**
    *   [ ] Collect NDA e-signatures; auto-expire if not signed by deadline.
    *   [ ] Provision access to beta content:
        *   [ ] Watermarked downloads (EPUB/PDF).
        *   [ ] Portal-only chapters for sensitive drops.

### Reading Window (T+0 to T+14 days)

1.  **Monitor & Remind:**
    *   [ ] Send mid-window reading reminder email.
    *   [ ] Monitor for anomalies (excessive downloads, sharing indicators) as per [[beta-program/anti-leak-measures]].

### Review Window (T+14 to T+21 days)

1.  **Open Feedback Forms:**
    *   [ ] Open the feedback forms in the beta portal.
    *   [ ] Send opening reminder email.
    *   [ ] Send 48-hour-left reminder email.
    *   [ ] Track submissions; triage support issues.

### Wrap-up (T+21 to Launch Day)

1.  **Compile Feedback:**
    *   [ ] Compile feedback themes and completion metrics.
    *   [ ] Mark non-compliant users (one strike → waitlist next cycle).
    *   [ ] Prepare launch-day conversion campaign.

### Launch Day

1.  **Convert Reviews:**
    *   [ ] Send "Convert your beta review to public" email.
    *   [ ] Track conversion percentage at 24/48/72 hours; send nudges as needed.
