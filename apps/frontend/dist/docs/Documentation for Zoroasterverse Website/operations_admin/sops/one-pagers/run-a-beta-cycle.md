# Admin SOP: Run a Beta Cycle (One-Pager)

**Objective:** To provide a high-level, one-page overview of the steps involved in running a full beta cycle, from planning to post-launch activities.

---

This one-pager summarizes the detailed steps found in the [[beta-cycle-checklist]].

### 1. Planning & Setup

*   **Define Cycle:** Determine the issue, reading window, and feedback deadline.
*   **Prepare Materials:** Finalize beta content, application form, and feedback form.
*   **Email Templates:** Ensure all communication templates are ready.

### 2. Application & Selection

*   **Open Applications:** Announce the beta and open the application form.
*   **Score & Rank:** After applications close, score and rank applicants using the [[beta-program/scoring-rubric-and-weights]] and [[beta-program/selection-algorithm]].
*   **Select Cohort:** Choose the final cohort based on score and [[beta-program/cohort-balancing-rules|diversity quotas]].
*   **Notify:** Send acceptance and waitlist emails.

### 3. Onboarding & Access

*   **NDA:** Collect signed NDAs from accepted beta readers.
*   **Provision Access:** Grant access to watermarked beta content (downloads or portal-only for sensitive material).

### 4. Reading & Feedback

*   **Reading Window:** Beta readers engage with the content.
*   **Reminders:** Send mid-window reading reminders and 48-hour feedback due reminders (see [[one-pagers/handle-reminders-and-conversions]]).
*   **Feedback Collection:** Beta readers submit their structured feedback via the portal.

### 5. Post-Cycle & Launch

*   **Compile Feedback:** Gather and analyze all submitted feedback.
*   **Identify Non-Compliant:** Note any readers who failed to meet obligations (see [[one-pagers/respond-to-breaches-revocations]] for handling).
*   **Launch Day Conversion:** On launch day, prompt beta readers to convert their beta review to a public review.
*   **Monitor:** Track public review conversion rates and initial public feedback.

### 6. Alumni Engagement

*   **Recognize:** Update beta reader statuses (e.g., `Alumni`, `Veteran`) and grant rewards (e.g., discounts, badges) as per [[beta-program/beta-alumni-strategy]].
*   **Engage:** Continue to engage with the beta alumni community between cycles.
