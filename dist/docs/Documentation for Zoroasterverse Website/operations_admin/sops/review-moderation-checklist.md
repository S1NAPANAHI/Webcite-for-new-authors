# Admin SOP: Review Moderation Checklist

**Objective:** To provide a step-by-step procedure for moderating user-submitted reviews, ensuring adherence to [[reviews/moderation-guidelines]] and maintaining a high-quality review section.

---

### 1. Intake and Queue Management

1.  **Access Moderation Queue:** Log into the admin panel and navigate to the review moderation queue.
2.  **Review Flagged Items:** Prioritize reviews flagged by automated systems (e.g., profanity, spam) or user reports.
3.  **Initial Assessment:** Quickly assess the review against the [[policies/reviews-and-community-guidelines]] for obvious violations.

### 2. Moderation Actions

For each review, choose one of the following actions:

*   **Approve:**
    *   [ ] Verify the review meets all guidelines.
    *   [ ] Ensure all spoilers are correctly marked with [[spoilers/capsules-pattern|spoiler capsules]].
    *   [ ] Publish the review.

*   **Edit (Light):**
    *   [ ] For minor issues (e.g., a forgotten spoiler tag, a slightly off-topic sentence).
    *   [ ] Manually redact specific words/phrases or move content into a spoiler capsule.
    *   [ ] Notify the reviewer of the edit and the reason (if system allows).
    *   [ ] Publish the edited review.

*   **Reject:**
    *   [ ] For clear policy breaches (e.g., hate speech, severe abuse, spam, off-topic content).
    *   [ ] Provide a brief, objective rationale for rejection.
    *   [ ] Notify the reviewer of the rejection and link to the relevant guideline.
    *   [ ] Do NOT publish the review.

### 3. Spoiler Handling

1.  **Auto-Wrap Verification:** If the system auto-wrapped spoilers, verify the wrapping is accurate and complete.
2.  **Manual Spoiler Marking:** If spoilers are present in non-spoiler sections, either edit the review to mark them or reject the review if editing is not feasible.

### 4. Escalation & Enforcement

1.  **Track Violations:** Log repeat violations by user accounts.
2.  **Issue Warnings:** For repeat minor violations, issue a formal warning.
3.  **Account Action:** For severe or persistent violations, initiate account restrictions or bans as per [[policies/reviews-and-community-guidelines]].

### 5. Logging & Reporting

1.  **Log All Actions:** Ensure all moderation actions (approve, edit, reject) are logged in the [[ops/qa-logs/review-moderation-log]], including moderator ID, timestamp, and reason.
2.  **Review Metrics:** Regularly review moderation metrics (e.g., approval rate, rejection reasons) to identify trends and improve guidelines.
