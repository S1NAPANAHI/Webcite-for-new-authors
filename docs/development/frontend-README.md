## Documentation Philosophy

This documentation follows these principles:

1. **Practical Over Perfect** - Focus on actionable guidance over theoretical completeness
2. **Living Documentation** - Keep docs updated with code changes
3. **Developer-Centric** - Written by developers, for developers
4. **Example-Driven** - Include code examples and real-world use cases
5. **Accessible** - Clear language and logical organization
