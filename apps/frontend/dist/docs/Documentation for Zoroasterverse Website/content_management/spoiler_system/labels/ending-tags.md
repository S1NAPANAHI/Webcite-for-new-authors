# Spoiler System: Ending Tags

**Objective:** To define a set of abstract, non-spoiler ending tags that categorize the nature of a narrative conclusion, allowing for filtering and discussion without revealing specific plot points.

---

These tags are used in the [[content-inventory/templates/route-nodes-and-endings|Route Nodes & Endings]] content schema and can be displayed in [[reviews/public-display-modules|review listings]] (when spoiler conditions are met).

### Defined Ending Tags

*   **Reprieve:** The protagonist or a key situation finds a moment of peace, safety, or resolution, though challenges may still exist.
*   **Severance:** A definitive break or loss occurs, often painful or irreversible, leading to a new, stark reality.
*   **Stalemate:** A situation reaches an impasse, with no clear victor or resolution, leaving things in a state of unresolved tension.
*   **Ascension:** The protagonist achieves a higher state of being, understanding, or power, often transcending previous limitations.
*   **Descent:** The protagonist experiences a significant fall from grace, power, or moral standing, leading to a darker outcome.
*   **Reunion:** Characters who were separated are brought back together, often with emotional significance.
*   **Isolation:** The protagonist ends up alone, physically or emotionally separated from others.

### Usage Notes

*   These tags are designed to be abstract enough to avoid spoilers while providing meaningful categorization.
*   They can be used in conjunction with [[route-labels-placeholder|Route Labels]] to give a more complete, yet still spoiler-safe, overview of a reader's journey.
*   Visibility of these tags in public-facing modules is governed by the [[modes-and-defaults|Spoiler System Modes]] and user ownership/progress.
