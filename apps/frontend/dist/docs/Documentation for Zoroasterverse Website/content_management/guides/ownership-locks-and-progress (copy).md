# ownership-locks-and-progress Guide

Define which works unlock detailed content by default:

- OwnershipLocks field lists WorkIDs that, when owned, reveal Standard capsule content.
- "Mark as finished" toggles grant access beyond ownership, unlocking further details across related entries.

Use locks for ties between content and release-based gating.
