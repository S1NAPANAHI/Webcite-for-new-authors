## 🔧 Development Guide

### File Organization Principles

1. **Components**: Reusable UI pieces go in `/components`
2. **Pages**: Each page gets its own file in `/app`
3. **Contexts**: Global state management in `/contexts`
4. **Styles**: Global styles in `globals.css`

### Coding Patterns Used

1. **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`
2. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Define data shapes and contracts
3. **Component Props**: Pass data between components
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Show different content based on state
5. **Event Handling**: Respond to user interactions

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **State Management**: How data flows through the application
2. **Authentication Flow**: Login/logout/session management
3. **Routing**: Navigation between pages
4. **Form Handling**: User input and validation
5. **Local Storage**: Persist data in browser
6. **Component Communication**: Parent-child data flow
