# Beta Reader Policy (Pre-NDA Summary)

**Title:** Beta Reader Policy (Pre-NDA Summary)

## Overview

- The [[beta-program]] provides early access to draft content in exchange for structured, timely feedback. Participation is limited and selection is merit-based.

## Selection Criteria

- Applicants are scored on:
  - **Availability & Reliability**: Consistent access and commitment
  - **Analytical Depth**: Quality and specificity of sample feedback
  - **Communication Tone**: Respectful, constructive, and actionable
  - **Genre Fit**: Comfort with branching narratives and multiple POVs
  - **Cohort Diversity**: Device type, timezone, and experience balance
- Cohorts consist of **40–60 readers per issue**, as detailed in [[cohort-balancing-rules]].

## Access & Reading Mode

- **Hybrid access**:
  - Download watermarked ebook files for general beta chapters
  - Portal-only access for highly sensitive content

## Obligations

- Submit structured feedback by the stated deadline via the portal form, as outlined in the [[beta-reader-handbook]].
- On launch day, convert your beta review into a public review using the approved templates (spoiler-free or spoiler-tagged).
- Engage respectfully in any follow-up discussions.

## Confidentiality & NDA

- All beta content is **confidential** until public release.
- Signing the NDA is required before accessing beta materials.
- **Leaks or unauthorized sharing** of content will result in immediate revocation of access and may lead to further action, as detailed in [[anti-leak-measures]].

## Enforcement & Continuity

- **One strike policy**: Missing deadlines or failing to convert your beta review → placement on waitlist for the next cycle, as per the [[beta-alumni-strategy]].
- Reinstatement is possible in future cycles upon demonstrated compliance.
- Policy or NDA breaches lead to immediate removal from the program.
