# Verified Purchase Rules

**Objective:** To define the criteria for granting a "Verified Purchase" badge to user reviews, enhancing credibility and trust in the review system.

---

### 1. Definition of "Verified Purchase"

A review is considered a "Verified Purchase" if the reviewer has successfully purchased and owns the digital product (ebook) they are reviewing through the Zoroasterverse store.

### 2. Criteria for Granting Badge

The "Verified Purchase" badge is automatically applied to a review if **all** of the following conditions are met:

*   The reviewer is logged into their Zoroasterverse account.
*   The reviewer's account has a record of a completed purchase for the specific `WorkID` and `Edition` being reviewed.
*   The review is submitted through the official review submission form in the user's library or product page.

### 3. Display of Badge

*   The "Verified Purchase" badge will be displayed prominently next to the reviewer's name on the [[public-display-modules|review card]] on all public-facing review listings.
*   The badge should have a tooltip explaining its meaning (e.g., "Reviewer has purchased this product through Zoroasterverse.com").

### 4. Exclusions

*   Reviews submitted by users who have not purchased the product (e.g., those who received a free copy outside of a beta program, or who read it elsewhere) will not receive a "Verified Purchase" badge.
*   Beta reviews, while valuable, will not receive a "Verified Purchase" badge until they are converted to a public review by a user who has subsequently purchased the product.

### 5. Purpose

*   **Credibility:** Increases the trustworthiness of reviews for potential buyers.
*   **Transparency:** Clearly distinguishes reviews from actual purchasers.
*   **Incentive:** Encourages users to purchase directly from the Zoroasterverse store.
