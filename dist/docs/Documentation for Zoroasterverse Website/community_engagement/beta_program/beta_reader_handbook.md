# The Zoroasterverse Beta Reader Handbook

**Version 1.0**

---

### 1. Welcome & Your Role

Welcome, and thank you for joining the Zoroasterverse beta program! You are now a key collaborator in the development of this series. Your feedback is not just helpfulâ€”it is essential to ensuring the quality, clarity, and impact of the story. 

This handbook is your guide to the process. Please read it carefully.

### 2. The Beta Cycle: What to Expect

Each beta cycle for a new issue follows a clear timeline. You can view the detailed schedule in the [[operational-timeline]].

*   **Reading Window (2 weeks):** This is your time to read and digest the material at your own pace.
*   **Feedback Window (1 week):** Following the reading window, you have one week to submit your structured feedback via the form in your portal.
*   **Launch Day:** On the official release day, you will be asked to convert your feedback into a public review.

Exact dates for each cycle will always be communicated to you via email.

### 3. Your Mandatory Tasks

To remain in good standing and be eligible for future beta cycles, you must complete the following three tasks by their deadlines:

1.  **[ ] Read the Material:** Engage with the provided chapters within the two-week reading window.
2.  **[ ] Submit Structured Feedback:** Complete the detailed feedback form in your beta portal. This is the most critical part of your role.
3.  **[ ] Convert to a Public Review:** On launch day, you must publish your review publicly. Your feedback form answers will be pre-populated to make this quick and easy.

### 4. The Review Framework: How to Give Great Feedback

We use a structured system to ensure feedback is consistent and valuable. Your application was scored based on our internal [[scoring-rubric-and-weights]], and we look for that same level of quality in your feedback. Your feedback form (and your final public review) will be built around these components:

*   **Rating (1-5 Stars):** Your honest rating is crucial. It directly feeds into the pre-release "Beta Average Score" that helps other readers.
*   **Headline & Quick Take:** A concise, punchy summary of your experience.
*   **Highlights (Tags):** You will be asked to select 2-3 tags that best describe the work's strengths (e.g., `Pacing`, `Character`, `Worldbuilding`, `Clarity`, `Emotional Impact`).
*   **Detailed Feedback (Spoiler-Safe & Spoilers):** The form will have separate sections for your detailed thoughts. Anything that could be a spoiler **must** go into the designated spoiler section.

### 5. The Rewards: What You Get

We deeply value your time and effort. In addition to early, free access to the story, here is how we recognize your contribution as detailed in our [[beta-alumni-strategy]]:

*   **Store Discount:** Upon successful completion of a beta cycle (all three mandatory tasks), you will receive a **15% discount coupon** for use on any item in the Zoroasterverse store.
*   **Profile Badges:** Your public profile on the website will display badges based on your participation (`Beta Alumni` for 1+ cycles, `Veteran Reader` for 3+ cycles).
*   **Community Access:** You will get access to a private alumni channel on our Discord/forum to discuss the series with other dedicated readers.
*   **Priority Access:** Readers in good standing get priority selection for future beta cycles.

### 6. The Rules & Penalties

To ensure the program is fair and effective, we have two critical rules:

1.  **The "One-Strike" Rule:** Failure to complete any of the three mandatory tasks by the deadline will result in you being moved to the waitlist for the next beta cycle. You can be reinstated in a future cycle by demonstrating your commitment.
2.  **Zero-Tolerance for Leaks:** Your participation is governed by a legally binding NDA. Any sharing, screenshotting, or leaking of beta material will result in immediate removal from the program and may trigger further action as outlined in the [[anti-leak-measures]] strategy.
