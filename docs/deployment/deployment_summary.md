### 3. Build & Testing Status
- ✅ **Build Fixed**: Resolved import path issues (CartContext, GripVerticalIcon)
- ⚠️ **Tests**: Some tests failing due to mocking setup and dependency issues
- ✅ **Component Tests**: Core component functionality tests passing
- ✅ **Storybook Configuration**: Ready for component documentation

### 4. Deployment Readiness
- **Staging Environment**: Dependencies resolved, build successful
- **Migration Scripts**: Available in `supabase/migrations/` directory
- **Rollback Scripts**: Comprehensive rollback procedures documented
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and build scripts ready

## Test Results Summary
- **Passing**: 45 tests (Core functionality working)
- **Failing**: 52 tests (Mainly mocking and API test issues)
- **Core Components**: All new components tests passing
- **Integration**: Some integration tests need mock updates

## Next Steps for Full Deployment
1. **Fix Test Mocks**: Update MSW and API test mocks
2. **Staging Deploy**: Deploy to staging environment
3. **Regression Testing**: Run full test suite on staging
4. **Production Deploy**: Deploy to production after validation

## Migration Process
1. Run `supabase migration apply` for database updates
2. Deploy application code to staging
3. Validate functionality with smoke tests
4. Deploy to production if staging tests pass
5. Monitor for issues and rollback if necessary
