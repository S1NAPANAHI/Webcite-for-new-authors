## API Endpoints

The admin system uses these API endpoints:

### Shop Management
- `GET /api/admin/shop` - Fetch all shop items
- `POST /api/admin/shop` - Create new item
- `PUT /api/admin/shop` - Update existing item
- `DELETE /api/admin/shop?id={id}` - Delete item

### Timeline Management
- `GET /api/admin/timeline` - Fetch all timeline events
- `POST /api/admin/timeline` - Create new event
- `PUT /api/admin/timeline` - Update existing event
- `DELETE /api/admin/timeline?id={id}` - Delete event

## Security Features

- **Role-based access:** Only users with `isAdmin: true` can access admin pages
- **Authentication required:** Must be logged in to access admin functions
- **Automatic redirects:** Non-admin users are redirected away from admin pages

## Data Storage

Currently using mock/temporary data storage in memory. In production, this would be connected to a database like:
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- Supabase
- Firebase

## Future Enhancements

1. **Media Upload System:** Direct file uploads for covers and images
2. **User Management:** Admin panel for managing user accounts
3. **Site Settings:** Global configuration management
4. **Analytics Dashboard:** User engagement and content metrics
5. **Content Scheduling:** Publish content at specific dates/times
6. **Bulk Operations:** Import/export content in bulk
7. **Version History:** Track changes to content over time

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Admin Panel
- Ensure you're logged in with admin credentials
- Check that the user has `isAdmin: true` in the database
- Clear browser cache and try again

### API Errors
- Check browser developer console for error messages
- Verify API endpoints are responding
- Ensure proper data format is being sent

### Form Submission Issues
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Check for proper data types (numbers for prices, etc.)
- Look for validation errors in the form

## Development Notes

- All admin pages use `'use client'` directive for React state
- Forms include loading states and error handling
- Data validation on both frontend and backend
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use

This admin system provides a solid foundation for content management that can be extended and enhanced as needed. The mock data system makes it perfect for development and testing, with easy migration to a real database when ready for production.
