# Reader Experience: Dedicated Series Page Specification

This document details the design and functionality of the dedicated series page, serving as a central hub for each novel series.

## 1. Objective

To provide a central hub for each novel series, visually displaying its entire hierarchy (Book > Volume > Saga > Arc > Issue) and allowing readers to navigate and explore content at various granularities.

## 2. Elements

*   **Series Overview:** Synopsis, main characters, themes.
*   **Hierarchical Navigation:** Interactive display of Books, Volumes, Sagas, Arcs, and Issues within the series. Each element should be clickable, leading to its respective product page.

*   **Call to Actions:** Links to purchase options (e.g., "Buy the Full Series," "Subscribe to Chapter Pass," "Explore Individual Arcs").
*   **Related Content:** Links to worldbuilding entries, character profiles, timelines relevant to the series.
