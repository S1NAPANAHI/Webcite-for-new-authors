# Section Visibility Fix Documentation

## Problem Description

The homepage section visibility toggles in the admin panel (Homepage Manager) were not working correctly. When an admin would:

1. Go to `/admin/content/homepage`
2. Navigate to the "Section Visibility" tab
3. Toggle any section (e.g., "Latest News", "Progress Metrics") to be hidden (unchecked)
4. Click "Save Settings"

The settings would save successfully to the database (as evidenced by successful API calls in the logs), but the actual homepage would still show all sections regardless of the toggle state.

## Console Logs Analysis

From the provided logs, we could see:
- ‚úÖ API calls were successful: `‚úÖ API Response: {success: true, data: {‚Ä¶}}`
- ‚úÖ Database updates were working: Multiple successful PUT requests to `/api/homepage/content`
- ‚úÖ Cache invalidation was working: `üîÑ Invalidating homepage caches after content update...`
- ‚ùå Frontend wasn't respecting the boolean flags

## Root Cause

The issue was in the conditional logic in `packages/ui/src/HomePage.tsx`. The original code used:

```typescript
{(sections?.show_progress_metrics !== false) && (
  // Section content
)}
```

### Why This Was Wrong

This logic has a fundamental flaw:
- When `sections?.show_progress_metrics` is `undefined` (no data loaded yet), `undefined !== false` evaluates to `true`
- When `sections?.show_progress_metrics` is `true`, `true !== false` evaluates to `true`
- When `sections?.show_progress_metrics` is `false`, `false !== false` evaluates to `false` ‚úì

So it only worked correctly when explicitly `false`, but would show sections by default when data wasn't loaded or was `undefined`.

## The Fix

Replaced the flawed conditional logic with a proper helper function:

```typescript
// Helper function to check if a section should be visible
const isSectionVisible = (sectionFlag: boolean | undefined, defaultValue: boolean = true): boolean => {
  // If sectionFlag is explicitly false, hide the section
  if (sectionFlag === false) {
    return false;
  }
  // If sectionFlag is true or undefined, use the default (which is true for all sections)
  return sectionFlag === true || (sectionFlag === undefined && defaultValue);
};
```

Then updated all section conditionals to use this function:

```typescript
{/* Statistics Section */}
{isSectionVisible(sections?.show_progress_metrics) && (
  <section className={styles.zrSection}>
    {/* Section content */}
  </section>
)}

{/* Latest News & Updates */}
{isSectionVisible(sections?.show_latest_news) && (
  <section className={styles.zrSection}>
    {/* Section content */}
  </section>
)}

{/* Latest Releases */}
{isSectionVisible(sections?.show_latest_releases) && (
  <LatestReleases releases={releaseData || []} />
)}

{/* Artist Collaboration */}
{isSectionVisible(sections?.show_artist_collaboration) && (
  <section className={styles.zrSection}>
    {/* Section content */}
  </section>
)}
```

## Additional Improvements

1. **Added Debug Logging**: Added console logs to track section visibility decisions:
   ```typescript
   console.log('üè† UI HomePage: Section visibility check:', {
     sections,
     show_progress_metrics: sections?.show_progress_metrics,
     show_latest_news: sections?.show_latest_news,
     show_latest_releases: sections?.show_latest_releases,
     show_artist_collaboration: sections?.show_artist_collaboration,
     progressVisible: isSectionVisible(sections?.show_progress_metrics),
     newsVisible: isSectionVisible(sections?.show_latest_news),
     releasesVisible: isSectionVisible(sections?.show_latest_releases),
     artistVisible: isSectionVisible(sections?.show_artist_collaboration)
   });
   ```

2. **Preserved Default Behavior**: Sections still show by default when no configuration is available, matching the database schema defaults.

3. **Type Safety**: The helper function properly handles `boolean | undefined` types.

## Database Schema Context

The database migration shows that all section visibility fields default to `true`:

```sql
show_latest_news BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
show_latest_releases BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
show_artist_collaboration BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
show_progress_metrics BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
```

The fix ensures the frontend respects these database values correctly.

## Testing the Fix

After deploying this fix:

1. Go to the Homepage Manager admin panel
2. Toggle any section visibility to "hidden" (unchecked)
3. Click "Save Settings"
4. Visit the homepage
5. The section should now be hidden as expected
6. Check browser console for debug logs showing section visibility decisions

## Files Changed

- `packages/ui/src/HomePage.tsx` - Fixed conditional logic and added helper function
- `SECTION_VISIBILITY_FIX.md` - This documentation file

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding loading states to show when section visibility is being determined
- Add admin preview mode to test section visibility without affecting the public homepage
- Consider adding animations for section hide/show transitions
