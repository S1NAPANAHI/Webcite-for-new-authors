-- üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE FIX: Update null/empty image paths with proper fallback images
-- This resolves the getSafeImageUrl warnings and MediaPicker display issues

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 1: Fix Character Images
-- ============================================================================
