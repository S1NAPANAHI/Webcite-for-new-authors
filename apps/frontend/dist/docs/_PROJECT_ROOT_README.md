## Getting Started

Navigate through the directories above to explore specific areas of the project. Each folder contains a `README.md` (or similar overview file) explaining its contents and linking to key documents within that section.

## Key Concepts

*   **Novel Hierarchy:** BOOK > VOLUME > SAGA > ARC > ISSUE > CHAPTER
*   **Flexible Purchasing:** Options to buy at various granularities (Issue, Arc, Book, etc.)
*   **Subscription Models:** Chapter Pass (recurring) and Arc Pass (one-time bundle)
*   **WIP Indicators:** Progress tracking for ongoing works
*   **Spoiler Control:** System for managing and revealing content based on reader progress

## Codebase Location

The actual website code is located in a separate top-level directory:

*   **[../Zoroasterverse/](../Zoroasterverse/)**

This separation ensures clarity between project planning/documentation and the codebase itself.

This README serves as your central guide to the project. For detailed information on any specific area, please refer to the respective feature folder.
