# üîç Cover Image Diagnostic and Fix Guide

## Issue Analysis
Cover images are uploaded successfully through the admin panel but not displaying in the library or detail pages.

## Root Cause
1. **Hook Return Type Mismatch**: The `useFileUrl` hook was returning `{url, loading, error}` but components expected just the URL string
2. **Missing File Resolution**: Library components weren't using the file utility to resolve `cover_file_id` to public URLs
3. **Import Path Issues**: Components may have incorrect import paths for the utility

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Fixed useFileUrl Hook
```typescript
// BEFORE: Returned object
export function useFileUrl(fileId) {
  return { url, loading, error }; // ‚ùå Object return
}

// AFTER: Returns string directly
export function useFileUrl(fileId) {
  return url; // ‚úÖ String return
}
```

### 2. Fixed LibraryPage.tsx
- Added `useFileUrl` import
- Added cover image resolution: `cover_file_id` ‚Üí `cover_image_url` ‚Üí placeholder
- Added extensive debug logging to track image resolution
- Added proper error handling for broken images

### 3. Fixed LibraryCard.tsx
- Added proper file URL resolution using `useFileUrl`
- Enhanced error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Improved UI with hover effects and loading states

### 4. Fixed ContentItemDetailPage.tsx
- Added `useMemo` to prevent infinite re-renders
- Fixed cover image resolution with proper fallbacks
- Enhanced error handling for missing database tables

## Testing Steps

### 1. Verify Database Data
Run this query in Supabase to check if cover files are properly linked:
```sql
SELECT 
  ci.id,
  ci.title,
  ci.cover_file_id,
  ci.cover_image_url,
  f.name as file_name,
  f.path as file_path,
  f.storage_path,
  f.url as file_url
FROM content_items ci
LEFT JOIN files f ON f.id = ci.cover_file_id
WHERE ci.status = 'published'
ORDER BY ci.created_at DESC;
```

### 2. Check Browser Console
After refreshing the library page, you should see debug logs like:
```
üîç getFileUrlById: Fetching file data for ID: abc123
üìÑ getFileUrlById: File data retrieved: {...}
‚úÖ getFileUrlById: Generated public URL: https://...
üé® LIBRARY CARD COVER DEBUG: {final_cover_url: "https://..."}
```

### 3. Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Library cards show uploaded cover images
- ‚úÖ Book detail pages show cover images  
- ‚úÖ Fallback icons appear for missing covers
- ‚úÖ No broken image placeholders
- ‚úÖ Console shows successful file resolution

## Debug Commands

### If images still don't appear:

1. **Check file URLs in browser console**
2. **Verify Supabase storage bucket permissions**
3. **Test direct file URL access**
4. **Check for CORS issues**

### Manual Test URLs
Try accessing a file URL directly:
```
https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/media/path/to/file.jpg
```

## Next Steps
1. Pull latest changes: `git pull`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
4. Check console for debug logs
5. Verify images display correctly

The fixes include extensive logging to help identify any remaining issues.
