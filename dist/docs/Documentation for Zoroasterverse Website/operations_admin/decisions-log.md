## Core Platform Decisions

### D001 - Content Management Strategy
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Implement a spoiler-aware content management system with three disclosure modes (Minimal, Standard, Full)  
**Rationale:** The interactive nature of the branching narrative requires sophisticated spoiler control to preserve reader experience while enabling deep engagement for completionist fans  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Single spoiler toggle (insufficient granularity)
- Content warnings only (doesn't address cross-linking complexity)
- Manual spoiler tagging without automation (too error-prone)
**Impact:** Requires custom CMS development with preview modes and automated lint checking  
**Status:** Approved  

### D002 - Audience Targeting and Age Rating
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Target 13+ audience with content warnings, no hard age gate  
**Rationale:** Dark themes warrant guidance without blocking access; builds trust through transparency  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- 16+ rating (potentially reduces audience)
- 18+ rating (unnecessarily restrictive)
- No age guidance (less responsible)
**Impact:** All content warnings and product descriptions must reflect 13+ guidance  
**Status:** Approved  

### D003 - Monetization Model
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Primary revenue through individual ebook sales, subscriptions deferred to Phase 4  
**Rationale:** Simpler implementation for MVP, proven model for digital content, subscriptions add complexity  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Subscription-first model (higher development complexity)
- Freemium with premium features (harder to monetize effectively)
- One-time purchase for entire series (reduces ongoing revenue)
**Impact:** Store and commerce systems designed for per-issue transactions with future subscription capability  
**Status:** Approved

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### D004 - File Distribution and DRM
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** 5 downloads per format with watermarking, no hard DRM  
**Rationale:** Balances user convenience with anti-piracy measures; DRM creates friction and support burden  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Unlimited downloads (higher piracy risk)
- Hard DRM (user experience friction)
- 3 downloads only (too restrictive)
**Impact:** Download tracking system required, watermarking implementation needed for beta files  
**Status:** Approved  

### D005 - Contact and Support Infrastructure
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Use zoroasterverse.com domain with role-based email addresses (support@, legal@, press@, beta@)  
**Rationale:** Professional appearance, clear routing for different inquiry types, scalable structure  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Single contact email (harder to route and prioritize)
- Third-party support platform (additional cost and complexity)
- Personal email addresses (less professional, harder to transfer)
**Impact:** Email infrastructure setup required, support workflows must be documented  
**Status:** Approved

## Beta Program Decisions

### D006 - Beta Reader Cohort Size and Structure
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** 40-60 readers per cohort with hybrid access (watermarked files + portal)  
**Rationale:** Large enough for statistical validity and diversity, small enough for manageable operations  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Small cohort (20-30): Faster to manage but less diverse feedback
- Large cohort (80-120): More feedback but higher operational burden
- Files-only access: Easier technically but less secure
**Impact:** Requires automated scoring system and cohort balancing algorithms  
**Status:** Approved  

### D007 - Beta Reader Obligations and Enforcement
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** One-strike policy (missed obligations = waitlist next cycle) with mandatory review conversion on launch day  
**Rationale:** Clear consequences encourage compliance while maintaining fairness; review conversion ensures continuity  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Three-strike policy (too lenient, poor accountability)
- Immediate permanent removal (too harsh)
- Optional review conversion (reduces public review volume)
**Impact:** Automated tracking system needed for compliance monitoring  
**Status:** Approved  

### D008 - Beta Program Timeline
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** 2 weeks reading + 1 week review submission per issue cycle  
**Rationale:** Sufficient time for thorough reading while maintaining reasonable release cadence  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- 1 week reading (too rushed for quality feedback)
- 3 weeks total (delays release timeline unnecessarily)
- Flexible deadlines (harder to manage operations)
**Impact:** All beta communications and automation must reflect this timeline  
**Status:** Approved

## User Experience Decisions

### D009 - Review System Architecture
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Dual template system (spoiler-free and spoiler-tagged) with "Beta Average Score" display pre-release  
**Rationale:** Accommodates different reviewer preferences while providing transparency about beta feedback quality  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Single template (forces all reviewers into same format)
- No beta score display (less transparency for pre-orders)
- Separate beta/public review systems (fragmentation)
**Impact:** Review submission forms need template selection, product pages need beta score integration  
**Status:** Approved  

### D010 - Library and Download Management
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Visual download counters with "Mark as Finished" toggle for spoiler unlocking  
**Rationale:** Transparent download tracking helps users manage limits; progress tracking enables smart spoiler gating  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Hidden download tracking (less transparent)
- Automatic progress detection (technically complex)
- Manual spoiler mode selection only (less convenient)
**Impact:** Library interface needs counter displays and progress tracking integration  
**Status:** Approved

## Content Strategy Decisions

### D011 - Route and Ending Labeling
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Use abstract route labels ("Silent Accord", "Iron Vow", etc.) to avoid raw spoilers in navigation  
**Rationale:** Enables route tracking and filtering without revealing narrative content to non-readers  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Chapter-based labeling (less meaningful for routes)
- Numerical codes (less memorable and engaging)
- Character-based routes (too spoiler-heavy)
**Impact:** All route-related content must use consistent abstract labeling system  
**Status:** Approved  

### D012 - Content Warnings Approach
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Standard set: "violence, war consequences, psychological manipulation, moral ambiguity" with note that warnings may contain mild spoilers  
**Rationale:** Covers major thematic elements while acknowledging inherent spoiler risk in detailed warnings  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Extremely detailed warnings (too spoiler-heavy)
- Minimal warnings only (less helpful for sensitive readers)
- Dynamic warnings per chapter (too complex to maintain)
**Impact:** All product pages and relevant wiki entries need consistent warning implementation  
**Status:** Approved

## Legal and Policy Decisions

### D013 - Copyright and Licensing Framework
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Â© 2025 Sina Panahi with personal-use license, explicit anti-sharing terms, and watermarking disclosure  
**Rationale:** Clear ownership while educating users about appropriate use; watermarking disclosure builds trust  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Creative Commons licensing (too permissive for commercial work)
- No explicit license terms (legal ambiguity)
- Harsher enforcement language (adversarial tone)
**Impact:** All legal pages, product pages, and file headers need consistent copyright language  
**Status:** Approved  

### D014 - Refund Policy for Digital Goods
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** 14-day window for defective/inaccessible files only, excluding buyer's remorse and completed downloads  
**Rationale:** Balances customer protection with digital goods reality; clear exclusions prevent abuse  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- 30-day window (too generous for digital goods)
- No refunds (too restrictive, damages trust)
- Unlimited refunds (open to abuse)
**Impact:** Refund processing workflow and customer service training required  
**Status:** Approved

## Implementation Planning Decisions

### D015 - Development Approach
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Complete design and planning phase before any coding begins  
**Rationale:** Complex feature interactions require thorough planning; early code commits can constrain design decisions  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Agile development with evolving requirements (risk of architectural debt)
- Prototype-first approach (might not address full complexity)
- Parallel design and development (higher risk of rework)
**Impact:** Extended planning phase required, but reduces development risk and cost  
**Status:** Approved  

### D016 - Project Structure and Documentation
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Modular folder structure with dedicated areas for policies, wireframes, content inventory, SOPs, and microcopy  
**Rationale:** Clear separation of concerns enables parallel work and easier maintenance; each deliverable has clear ownership  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Single document approach (harder to maintain and collaborate)
- Feature-based organization (creates dependencies and duplication)
- Tool-specific organization (less transferable)
**Impact:** All team members need to understand and follow folder structure conventions  
**Status:** Approved

## Deferred Decisions

### D017 - Subscription Tiers (Deferred to Phase 4)
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Defer subscription implementation while designing architecture to accommodate future subscriptions  
**Rationale:** Focus on core functionality first; subscription complexity can be added once base platform is stable  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Implement subscriptions in MVP (increases complexity significantly)
- Never implement subscriptions (limits long-term revenue potential)
**Impact:** Data models and user management must be subscription-ready even if not implemented initially  
**Status:** Deferred  

### D018 - Community Forums (Deferred to Phase 4)
**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Decision:** Start with reviews only, add forums in later phase if community demand exists  
**Rationale:** Reviews provide community feedback with less moderation burden; forums require significant ongoing management  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Launch with forums immediately (higher operational overhead)
- Never implement forums (limits community building)
**Impact:** Community engagement strategy focuses on reviews and beta program initially  
**Status:** Deferred
