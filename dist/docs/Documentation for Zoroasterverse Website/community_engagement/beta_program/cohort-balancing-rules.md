# Cohort Balancing Rules

Specifies quotas and rules for assembling a diverse beta cohort.

## Target Cohort Size
- 40–60 participants per issue.

## Quotas
- **Device Mix**: Minimum 25% EPUB-eReader; minimum 25% PDF-desktop/tablet.
- **Timezones**: Aim for ≥25% representation from Americas, Europe/Africa, Asia/Oceania each.
- **Experience**: At least 30% first-time beta readers; at least 30% experienced (≥1 prior beta).
- **Formats**: Ensure both EPUB and PDF preferences are covered.

## Enforcement
- Iterate through ranked list; select candidates while maintaining quotas.
- If quotas are not met, skip lower-ranked candidates until quotas fill.
- Fill remaining slots with next highest-ranked applicants.

## Waitlist Construction
- Top 20–30% after cohort cutoff, preserving quota diversity.
- Backfill from waitlist to address dropouts or quota deficits.
