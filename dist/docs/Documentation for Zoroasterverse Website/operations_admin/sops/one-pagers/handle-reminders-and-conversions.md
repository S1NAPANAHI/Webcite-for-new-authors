# Admin SOP: Handle Reminders and Conversions (Beta Program)

**Objective:** To provide a concise guide for managing beta reader reminders during a cycle and ensuring successful conversion of beta reviews to public reviews on launch day.

---

This SOP is part of the broader [[beta-cycle-checklist]].

### 1. Reminder Cadence

*   **Mid-Window Reading Reminder:**
    *   **Timing:** Sent approximately halfway through the reading window (e.g., Day 7 of a 14-day reading window).
    *   **Purpose:** To gently nudge readers who may have started but not finished, or to remind those who haven't started yet.
    *   **Content:** "Beta Check-In - How's the Read Going?" (See [[beta-program/emails/reading-reminder.txt]]).

*   **Review Window Opening Reminder:**
    *   **Timing:** Sent at the start of the review window (e.g., Day 15).
    *   **Purpose:** To inform readers that the feedback form is now open.
    *   **Content:** "Feedback Form Now Open!" (Custom email).

*   **48-Hour Feedback Due Reminder:**
    *   **Timing:** Sent 48 hours before the feedback deadline.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a final, urgent reminder for submission.
    *   **Content:** "48 Hours Left - Feedback Due [deadline]" (See [[beta-program/emails/review-reminder.txt]]).

### 2. Launch Day Conversion

*   **Launch Day Conversion Email:**
    *   **Timing:** Sent on the official launch day of the issue.
    *   **Purpose:** To prompt beta readers to convert their private beta feedback into a public review.
    *   **Content:** "It's Live - Convert Your Beta Review Today" (See [[beta-program/emails/launchday-conversion.txt]]).

*   **Tracking Conversion:**
    *   Monitor the conversion rate of beta reviews to public reviews within the first 24, 48, and 72 hours post-launch, as tracked in [[beta-program/metrics-and-dashboards]].
    *   Send follow-up nudges if conversion rates are low.

### 3. Handling Non-Compliance

*   **Identify Non-Compliant Readers:** At the end of the review window, identify readers who failed to submit feedback or convert their review.
*   **Apply "One-Strike" Rule:** As per the [[beta-program/beta-reader-handbook]], these readers are moved to the waitlist for the next beta cycle.
*   **Communication:** Send appropriate notification (e.g., a custom email informing them of their status change).
