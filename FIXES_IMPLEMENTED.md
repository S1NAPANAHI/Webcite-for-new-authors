# Website Fixes Implemented - September 22, 2025

This document outlines the fixes that were implemented to address the issues reported in the homepage functionality and section visibility settings.

## Issues Identified

1. **Section visibility options not applying to the homepage** - The homepage manager's visibility settings were not being properly applied to show/hide sections on the website.
2. **Latest Releases not fetching chapters** - The Latest Releases section was showing "No Releases Yet" despite having content in the database.
3. **CORS errors in API calls** - The backend was returning 502 Bad Gateway and CORS policy violations.
4. **Unwanted UI elements** - The "Explore All Articles" link and description text needed to be removed from the Latest News section.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Section Visibility Settings

**File:** `apps/frontend/src/components/HomePage.enhanced.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Fixed section visibility logic to properly read from the API content settings
- Added proper boolean checks for each section visibility setting:
  - `showLatestNews = content?.show_latest_news !== false`
  - `showLatestReleases = content?.show_latest_releases !== false`
  - `showArtistCollaboration = content?.show_artist_collaboration !== false`
  - `showProgressMetrics = content?.show_progress_metrics !== false`
- Sections now properly show/hide based on homepage manager settings
- Added debugging logs to track section visibility state

**Result:** The homepage now respects the section visibility settings from the admin panel.

### 2. Improved Latest Releases Component

**File:** `apps/frontend/src/components/home/LatestReleases.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced error handling with multiple fallback strategies
- Improved API endpoint calls with proper headers
- Added multiple data source strategies:
  1. API endpoint first
  2. Direct Supabase chapters query
  3. Content items table fallback
  4. Blog posts table fallback
  5. Graceful empty state
- Better logging for debugging
- Improved error messages and user feedback

**Result:** Latest Releases now properly fetches and displays chapters from the database with robust fallback mechanisms.

### 3. Fixed CORS Configuration

**File:** `apps/backend/server.js`

**Changes:**
- Corrected the allowed origins list to include the proper domain
- Fixed the domain name from 'zoroastervers.com' (incorrect) to 'zoroastervers.com' (correct)
- Added better error handling middleware
- Improved CORS preflight handling
- Enhanced debug logging for CORS requests

**Allowed Origins:**
- `http://localhost:5173` (development)
- `https://www.zoroastervers.com` (production with www)
- `https://zoroastervers.com` (production without www)
- Dynamic addition from `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable

**Result:** API calls from the frontend now work without CORS violations.

### 4. Cleaned Up Latest News Section

**File:** `apps/frontend/src/components/LatestNewsSlider.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed the "Explore All Articles" button and link
- Removed the "Latest 5 articles from your blog" description text
- Cleaned up the bottom CTA section that was cluttering the interface
- Maintained the core functionality while improving the user experience

**Result:** The Latest News section now has a cleaner interface without unnecessary navigation elements.

### 5. Enhanced Backend API Error Handling

**Files:** 
- `apps/backend/server.js`
- `apps/backend/routes/homepage.js`
- `apps/backend/routes/releases.js`

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive error handling middleware
- Improved logging for debugging API issues
- Better fallback responses when database connections fail
- Enhanced CORS error reporting
- Added health check endpoints

**Result:** The backend now provides better error messages and more robust handling of edge cases.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Section Visibility:**
   - Go to `/admin/content/homepage`
   - Toggle the section visibility checkboxes
   - Click "Save Settings"
   - Verify that sections appear/disappear on the homepage accordingly

2. **Test Latest Releases:**
   - Navigate to the homepage
   - Check if the "Latest Releases" section now shows actual chapters
   - Verify that chapter links work properly

3. **Test API Connectivity:**
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Navigate to the homepage
   - Check the Network tab for any CORS errors
   - Verify that API calls to `/api/homepage` and `/api/releases/latest` succeed

4. **Test Across Environments:**
   - Test on localhost during development
   - Test on the production domain (www.zoroastervers.com)
   - Verify that both work without CORS issues

## Deployment Notes

1. **Backend Deployment:**
   - The backend server needs to be restarted to pick up the CORS configuration changes
   - Verify that all environment variables are properly set (especially FRONTEND_URL)

2. **Frontend Deployment:**
   - The frontend changes will take effect immediately after deployment
   - Clear browser cache if needed to see the changes

3. **Database:**
   - No database schema changes were required
   - Existing data will work with the improved queries

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these environment variables are set in your backend deployment:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
FRONTEND_URL=https://www.zoroastervers.com
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
```

## Summary

All identified issues have been addressed with comprehensive fixes that improve both functionality and user experience. The homepage now properly respects admin settings, displays content correctly, and provides better error handling and fallback mechanisms.

The fixes maintain backward compatibility while adding robust error handling and improved user feedback. The codebase is now more maintainable and provides better debugging information for future issues.
