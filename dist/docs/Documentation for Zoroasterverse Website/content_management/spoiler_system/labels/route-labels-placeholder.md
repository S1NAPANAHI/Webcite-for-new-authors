# Spoiler System: Route Labels (Placeholder)

**Objective:** To define a set of abstract, non-spoiler route labels that categorize distinct narrative paths within the branching story, allowing for filtering and discussion without revealing specific plot points.

---

These labels are used in the [[content-inventory/templates/route-nodes-and-endings|Route Nodes & Endings]] content schema and can be displayed in [[reviews/public-display-modules|review listings]] (when spoiler conditions are met).

### Defined Route Labels (Placeholder Set)

*   **Silent Accord:** Represents a path characterized by diplomacy, subtle influence, or hidden agreements.
*   **Iron Vow:** Represents a path defined by strong commitments, direct confrontation, or unyielding principles.
*   **Ember Path:** Represents a path involving difficult choices, sacrifice, or a journey through hardship.
*   **Veiled Tide:** Represents a path where events unfold subtly, with hidden currents, or where deception plays a key role.
*   **Broken Oath:** Represents a path where promises are shattered, trust is betrayed, or previous allegiances are abandoned.
*   **Glass Crown:** Represents a path focused on fragile power, precarious leadership, or the burdens of authority.
*   **Pale Lantern:** Represents a path of seeking knowledge, uncovering secrets, or navigating through uncertainty.
*   **Thorn Pact:** Represents a path involving difficult alliances, necessary evils, or agreements with dangerous entities.

### Usage Notes

*   These labels are designed to be abstract and evocative, providing a hint of the narrative flavor without giving away specific plot details.
*   They can be used in conjunction with [[ending-tags|Ending Tags]] to give a more complete, yet still spoiler-safe, overview of a reader's journey.
*   Visibility of these labels in public-facing modules is governed by the [[modes-and-defaults|Spoiler System Modes]] and user ownership/progress.
*   This is a **placeholder set** and can be fully customized to better reflect the specific themes and branches of the Zoroasterverse narrative.
