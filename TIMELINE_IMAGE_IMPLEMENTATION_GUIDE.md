# Timeline Image System Implementation Guide

## Overview

This update adds comprehensive image support to your timeline system, enabling you to add artwork to:
- **Timeline Eras (Ages)** - Background images for each age/era
- **Timeline Events** - Hero background images for major events
- **Nested Events (Sub-events)** - Thumbnail images for related chronicles

## Features Added

### üé® Visual Enhancements
- **Age Cards**: Display representative images as backgrounds in the cosmic ring nodes
- **Event Cards**: Hero images with gradient overlays and enhanced layouts
- **Nested Events**: Grid layout with thumbnail images and proper image loading states
- **Loading States**: Smooth image loading with spinners and fallbacks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when images fail to load

### üíæ Database Structure
- Added `image_url` and `image_alt` fields to `timeline_eras`
- Added `image_alt` field to `timeline_events` (background_image already existed)
- Created `timeline_nested_events` table with image support
- Proper foreign key relationships and RLS policies

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard or psql:
psql -f database/migrations/003_add_timeline_images.sql
```

Or apply the migration in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `database/migrations/003_add_timeline_images.sql`
4. Execute the migration

### 2. Populate with Sample Images

```bash
# Install dependencies if not already installed
npm install @supabase/supabase-js dotenv

# Run the sample images script
node add_timeline_sample_images.js
```

Make sure you have these environment variables set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### 3. Verify Deployment

1. Check that your frontend builds successfully:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Test the timeline page:
   - Visit `/timelines` on your website
   - Age nodes should show image backgrounds
   - Event cards should display hero images
   - Nested events should show thumbnails in the expanded view

## Database Schema Changes

### New Fields Added:

**timeline_eras table:**
- `image_url TEXT` - URL for the era's representative image
- `image_alt TEXT` - Alt text for accessibility

**timeline_events table:**
- `image_alt TEXT` - Alt text for the existing background_image field

**timeline_nested_events table:** (newly created)
- `id UUID` - Primary key
- `timeline_event_id UUID` - Foreign key to timeline_events
- `title VARCHAR(200)` - Nested event title
- `description TEXT` - Nested event description
- `date VARCHAR(100)` - Nested event date
- `image_url TEXT` - Nested event image
- `image_alt TEXT` - Alt text for accessibility
- `order_index INTEGER` - For ordering nested events
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

## Component Updates

### AgeNode.tsx
- Added support for SVG pattern-based image backgrounds
- Image indicator dots for ages with images
- Enhanced hover states and visual feedback
- Proper fallbacks when images aren't available

### EventCard.tsx
- Hero image header with gradient overlays
- Loading states with spinners
- Date badges positioned over images
- Glyph icons with backdrop blur on images
- "Illustrated" indicator tag for events with images

### CodexEntry.tsx
- Full-width hero images for expanded event view
- Grid layout for nested events with thumbnail images
- Loading and error states for all images
- Proper image alt text handling
- Enhanced visual hierarchy

### API Updates
- Updated TypeScript interfaces with image fields
- Modified fetch functions to include image data
- Support for both old and new database structures
- Proper nested events handling with images

## Sample Images Provided

The system includes high-quality sample images from Unsplash:

### Era Images:
- **Ancient Times**: Mystical ancient landscape
- **Classical Period**: Greek temple architecture
- **Medieval Era**: Castle on misty hill
- **Renaissance**: Classical art and architecture
- **Modern Age**: Futuristic cityscape

### Event Images:
- Epic fantasy scenes with proper aspect ratios
- Hero images optimized for card layouts
- Gradient overlays for text readability

### Nested Event Images:
- Thumbnail-sized images (600x400)
- Consistent with the fantasy theme
- Proper loading states and fallbacks

## Customization

### Adding Your Own Images

1. **For Eras**: Update the `timeline_eras` table:
   ```sql
   UPDATE timeline_eras 
   SET image_url = 'your-image-url', image_alt = 'descriptive alt text'
   WHERE name = 'Era Name';
   ```

2. **For Events**: Update the `timeline_events` table:
   ```sql
   UPDATE timeline_events 
   SET background_image = 'your-image-url', image_alt = 'descriptive alt text'
   WHERE title = 'Event Title';
   ```

3. **For Nested Events**: Update the `timeline_nested_events` table:
   ```sql
   UPDATE timeline_nested_events 
   SET image_url = 'your-image-url', image_alt = 'descriptive alt text'
   WHERE title = 'Nested Event Title';
   ```

### Image Recommendations

**Era Images**: 
- Recommended size: 800x600px or larger
- Aspect ratio: 4:3 or 16:9
- Focus on representative themes for each era

**Event Hero Images**:
- Recommended size: 1200x800px or larger
- Aspect ratio: 3:2 (works well with gradient overlays)
- High contrast subjects work best

**Nested Event Thumbnails**:
- Recommended size: 600x400px
- Aspect ratio: 3:2
- Clear, focused subjects

## Accessibility Features

- All images include proper `alt` text
- Loading states with descriptive text
- Keyboard navigation preserved
- Screen reader friendly
- Fallback content when images fail

## Performance Considerations

- Images are loaded on-demand with loading states
- Proper error handling prevents broken layouts
- Optimized image sizes using Unsplash parameters
- CSS transitions for smooth loading

## Next Steps

After implementing this system:

1. üé® **Replace Sample Images**: Add your own artwork that matches your story
2. üìù **Add More Content**: Create additional events and nested events
3. üîß **Admin Interface**: Consider building an admin panel for image management
4. üì± **Mobile Optimization**: Test and refine the mobile experience
5. üñ∫ **Image Management**: Set up proper image storage and CDN if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing?
1. Check browser console for CORS errors
2. Verify image URLs are accessible
3. Ensure database migration was applied successfully
4. Check that `image_url` fields are populated

### Slow Loading?
1. Optimize image sizes
2. Consider using a CDN
3. Implement lazy loading for better performance

### Database Issues?
1. Verify the migration ran without errors
2. Check RLS policies are correctly applied
3. Ensure foreign key constraints are working
