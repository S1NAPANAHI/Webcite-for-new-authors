# Wireframes

This folder contains low-fidelity wireframes and corresponding annotation files for each key screen in the MVP. Each subfolder represents a screen with:

- `<screen>.png`: The wireframe image (to be created or inserted)
- `<screen>-annotations.md`: Detailed notes on layout, copy, interactions, and state variants

Subfolders:

- product-page
- library
- character
- event
- beta-flow
- reviews

Follow the structure and replace placeholder images with final exports.
