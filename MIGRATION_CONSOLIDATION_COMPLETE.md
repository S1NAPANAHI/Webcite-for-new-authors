## 📁 Current Migration Structure

Your `supabase/migrations/` folder now contains only these **7 essential files**:

```
📁 supabase/migrations/
├── 20250821000000_fix_rls_recursion.sql              (RLS fixes)
├── 20250821000100_fix_remaining_rls_recursion.sql    (Additional RLS fixes)  
├── 20250824000000_fix_profile_rls.sql                (Profile-specific RLS)
├── 20250824000001_create_detailed_audit_log_view.sql (Audit logging views)

└── 99999999999999_unified_zoroasterverse_schema.sql  (🌟 MAIN MIGRATION)
```

## 🗑️ Files Removed (25 obsolete files)

**Successfully cleaned up:**
- 5 core schema files (users, content, wiki, ecommerce, misc)
- 8 individual table addition files (pages SEO, user stats, etc.)
- 9 feature-specific table files (beta apps, promotions, etc.)
- 3 content update files (wiki content, timeline events, etc.)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Apply the Unified Migration**
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Copy and paste the contents of 99999999999999_unified_zoroasterverse_schema.sql
```

### 2. **Validate the Migration**
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Copy and paste the contents of validate-unified-migration.sql
```

### 3. **Complete Stripe Setup**
You still need to complete these 2 tasks from your original Stripe setup:

#### A. Create Products in Stripe Dashboard
- **Monthly**: Product ID `prod_SyHh0v9pcletkx`, Price ID `price_1S2L8JQv3TvmaocsYofzFKgm` ($9.99/month)
- **Annual**: Product ID `prod_SyHiFk24bHGA2U`, Price ID `price_1S2L95Qv3TvmaocsN5zRIEXO` ($99.99/year)

#### B. Configure Webhooks
- **Endpoint URL**: `https://zoroasterverse.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
- **Add webhook secret** to your backend `.env`
