### "Fresh" Score Calculation

To provide a "Rotten Tomatoes" style metric, a "Fresh" score will be calculated and displayed. 

- **Definition:** A review is considered "Fresh" if it has a rating of 4 or 5 stars.
- **Calculation:** The Fresh Ratio is the percentage of total reviews (either Beta or Public) that are "Fresh".
- **Display:** A "Fresh" badge can be displayed next to the average score if the ratio is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70%).
