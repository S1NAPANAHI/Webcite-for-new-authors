const handleFeaturedImageCrop = (croppedFile: File) => {
  uploadImage(croppedFile, 'featured');

};
```

**Added crop buttons to existing image displays:**

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Featured Images:
- **Use high-resolution images** (at least 1200px wide)
- **Landscape orientation** works best
- **Crop to show the most important part** of your image
- **Leave some space** around key elements when cropping

### Social Images:
- **Square format** is ideal for most platforms
- **Keep important elements in the center** of the crop
- **Use contrasting colors** for better visibility
- **Test how it looks at small sizes** (social media thumbnails)
