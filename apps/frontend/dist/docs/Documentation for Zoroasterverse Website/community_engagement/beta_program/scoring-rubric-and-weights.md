# Scoring Rubric and Weights

Defines criteria, scoring scale, and weightings used to evaluate beta program applications.

## Criteria (Each scored 0–5)
1. **Analytical Depth**: Specificity, evidence, and clarity of reasoning in sample feedback.
2. **Reliability & Availability**: Demonstrated availability during the beta window and track record.
3. **Communication Tone**: Respectfulness, constructiveness, and actionable phrasing.
4. **Genre Fit**: Familiarity with branching narratives and multi-POV structure.
5. **Diversity Mix**: Contribution to cohort diversity (device, timezone, experience).

## Weights
- Analytical Depth ×1.5
- Reliability & Availability ×1.25
- Genre Fit ×1.25
- Communication Tone ×1.0
- Diversity Mix ×1.0

## Score Computation
1. Normalize each raw score (0–5) to weighted: `weighted_score = raw_score × weight`.
2. Sum weighted scores to compute `total_score`.
3. Use `total_score` to rank applicants.

## Quick Reference Rubrics
- **Analytical Depth**
  - 5: Cites multiple examples, explains reasoning, offers actionable fixes.
  - 3: General observations with some reasoning.
  - 1: Vague, minimal evidence.
- **Communication Tone**
  - 5: Respectful, objective, solution-focused.
  - 3: Neutral, minimal detail.
