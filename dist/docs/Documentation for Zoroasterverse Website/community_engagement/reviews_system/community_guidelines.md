# Reviews & Community Guidelines

**Title:** Reviews & Community Guidelines

## Purpose

- Reviews guide readers and provide valuable feedback to the author. All contributions should be honest, respectful, and helpful.

## Be Constructive

- Focus on specific elements: pacing, character development, worldbuilding, clarity, continuity, and emotional impact.
- Explain what worked or needs improvement and why.
- Avoid vague statements; support opinions with examples from the text.

## Spoiler Rules

- Major plot points, ending outcomes, and route-specific spoilers must be placed within a spoiler section.
- Use the spoiler-free template for general impressions. If discussing significant details, use spoiler tags.
- The system may auto-detect spoilers and wrap content in spoiler sections if tags are omitted. This is part of the [[spoiler-lint-rules]].

## Respect and Relevance

- Maintain a respectful tone. No harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, or doxxing.
- No spam, unrelated promotions, or off-topic links.
- Keep reviews relevant to the specific edition and content reviewed.

## Moderation

- Reviews may be moderated or removed for:
  - Undisclosed spoilers outside spoiler sections.
  - Abusive language or harassment.
  - Spam, self-promotion, or off-topic content.
- Repeat violations can lead to content removal and account restrictions, as detailed in the [[sops/review-moderation-checklist]].

## Badges and Verification

- **Verified Purchase** badges denote reviews from users who own the product.
- Beta readers must convert their beta review into a public review on launch day to maintain eligibility for future cycles, as per the [[beta-reader-handbook]].

## Reporting

- To report a review: use the in-page report function or email support@zoroasterverse.com with the review link and reason.
