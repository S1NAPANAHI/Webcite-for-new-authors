# ðŸŒŒ Cosmic Timeline - Phase 1 Implementation

This package contains all the files needed to implement Phase 1 of your Cosmic Timeline project.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Directory Setup
```bash
chmod +x setup_directories.sh
./setup_directories.sh
```

### Step 2: Database Setup
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire content of `database_setup.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute

### Step 3: Verify Installation
After running both scripts, you should have:
- âœ… New directory structure in `apps/frontend/src/`
- âœ… Backed up existing timeline files (if any)
- âœ… 3 new database tables: `ages`, `books`, `book_age_spans`
- âœ… 9 Ages and 5 Books populated in database
- âœ… Book-Age relationships established

## Directory Structure Created
```
apps/frontend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ glyphs/                    # SVG glyph icons
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ timeline/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ CosmicRings/          # Circular cosmic interface
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ LinearTimeline/       # Horizontal timeline panel
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Navigation/           # Navigation components
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ hooks/                # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/                     # React Context providers
â””â”€â”€ styles/                       # Theme and styling
```

## Database Schema
- **ages**: 9 cosmic ages with glyphs and color themes
- **books**: 5 chronicle books spanning different ages
- **book_age_spans**: Relationships linking books to ages

## Next Steps
After completing Phase 1:
1. Verify all directories exist
2. Confirm database tables are populated
3. Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Component Implementation

## Troubleshooting
- If directories already exist, the script will not overwrite them
- If database tables exist, the script uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- Existing timeline files are safely backed up with `.classic` suffix

Ready for Phase 2? The next phase will implement the actual React components, theme system, and glyph library!
