# Open Questions

This document captures the key unresolved questions and decisions that require input before moving forward. These questions guide our next steps and ensure clarity across all stakeholders.

## Policy & Governance

1. DRM Strategy
   - Should we adopt a permissive watermark-only approach or implement stricter DRM for ebooks?
   - What are the acceptable download limits and reset policies for each approach?

2. Subscription Tiers
   - Which perks and access levels should be associated with each subscription tier (Season Pass, Lore+ Membership, Founders Tier)?
   - What price targets align with market expectations and perceived value?

3. Content Rating & Age Guidance
   - Is '13+ recommended' sufficient, or should we raise to '16+' for thematic warnings?
   - Should any specific content warrant an age gate versus simple content warnings?

## Beta Program

4. Beta Cohort Parameters
   - Confirm final cohort size for Cycle 1 (20–30, 40–60, or 80–120).
   - Define acceptable ratios for first-time vs. experienced beta readers.

5. Beta Feedback Requirements
   - Should conversion to a public review on launch day be mandatory or optional for eligibility in future cycles?
   - What constitutes a "meaningful" structured feedback submission for compliance?

## Spoiler System

6. Default Spoiler Modes
   - Finalize default modes for guests, logged-in non-owners, and owners.
   - Determine if additional intermediate modes are needed for specific content types.

7. Spoiler Capsule Labeling
   - Confirm consistent naming conventions for branch and ending labels (e.g., 'Silent Accord').
   - Decide whether to abstract branch names further to avoid accidental spoilers.

## Content & IA

8. Glossary Scope
   - Which key worldbuilding terms and concepts should be included in the initial glossary?
   - Prioritize terms that aid navigation and comprehension for new readers.

9. Content Inventory Initial Scope
   - Determine sample size for initial content entry (issues, characters, events) to validate workflows.

## Technical & Architecture

10. Tech Stack Finalization
    - Confirm primary CMS/platform choice (e.g., headless CMS) and supporting tech stack.
    - Identify necessary integrations (search engine, analytics, email service).

11. Localization & Accessibility
    - Decide initial support for languages beyond English.
    - Confirm priority accessibility features for MVP versus later phases.
